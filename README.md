StoryStore
==========

StoryStore is a community for writers who want somewhere to share their ideas so that they can get recognition, inspiration and feedback. Launched in November 2012, it's a hub for your creativity and will be adding features for a long time to come!

## All of your inspirations in one place.

StoryStore is a hub for everything related to your project. Document your favourite details about your characters, the locations you're using, listen to influential music and view inspiring images, all hand-picked by you.

## Write beautiful stores in a beautiful editor.

The best ideas come when there is as little distractions as possible, so we've used the simple but powerful RTE Redactor for you to keep your mind clear of everything but your story.

## Get feedback from like-minded writers.

We're firm believers in always building and improving our ideas, so we ask the community to help us out. Get your project rated and get detailed feedback from your friends, family and peers, or simply other writers who follow your ideas.

## Feed your ideas on-the-go

StoryStore's fully responsive, lightweight design works on desktops, laptops, smartphones and even Internet Explorer! So no matter where you are or what device you own - you can create.
