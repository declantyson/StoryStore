<h1>About StoryStore</h1>

<p>StoryStore is a community for writers who want somewhere to share their ideas so that they can get recognition, inspiration and feedback. Launched in November 2012, it's a hub for your creativity and will be adding features for a long time to come!</p>

<h2>How do I begin?</h2>

<p>Registering for StoryStore couldn't be easier, and it's completely, 100% free. So if you're interested, <a href="/register">register here</a>, enter your name, e-mail and choose a password, and upload an avatar if you like. Once you're in you'll be directed to your profile, where you can create projects - see the <a href="/help">help section</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>What features are going to be added to StoryStore in the future?</h2>

<p>StoryStore is currently on version 1.01 (codenamed Great British Dangerzone). In the next version the minimum additions we plan to make are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The ability to leave feedback on individual elements of a project</li>
	<li>Get notifications of feedback</li>
	<li>An option to "borrow" other inspirations and music and import them into your own projects</li>
	<li>Various other bugfixes that will inevitably arise</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have feature requests, either <a href="mailto:declantyson@hotmail.co.uk">e-mail the dev team</a> or submit a feature request issue on the <a href="https://github.com/declantyson/great-british-dangerzone/issues">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<h2>For the techies</h2>

<p>StoryStore is an open-source Rails application, so feel free to check out the code on <a href="https://github.com/declantyson/great-british-dangerzone/">GitHub</a> to fix bugs, add features, or just plain rip-off the code (please credit me in some way or another if you do!).</p>
