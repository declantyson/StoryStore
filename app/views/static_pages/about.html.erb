<h1>About StoryStore</h1>

<p>StoryStore is a community for writers who want somewhere to share their ideas so that they can get recognition, inspiration and feedback. Launched in November 2012, it's a hub for your creativity and will be adding features for a long time to come!</p>

<h2>How do I begin?</h2>

<p>Registering for StoryStore couldn't be easier, and it's completely, 100% free. So if you're interested, <a href="/register">register here</a>, enter your name, e-mail and choose a password, and upload an avatar if you like.

</ul>
